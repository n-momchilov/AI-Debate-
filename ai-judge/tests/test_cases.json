      "title": "Medical Emergency Parking (Defense-Favored)",
      "description": "A parent briefly stopped (~2 minutes) in a disabled bay outside a pharmacy with hazard lights on to urgently pick up a child's life-saving asthma medication during an acute episode. Pharmacy staff corroborate the timeline; security footage confirms no disabled permit holder attempted to use the space during that interval. A clinician note documents the child's condition and timing. Local ordinance recognizes a necessity defense for imminent threats to health and safety when no reasonable lawful alternative exists. The ticket cites 'no permit displayed' but omits these mitigating facts."
